    "There are many ways to use the power of Data Science for good: data can be used to solve social issues, environmental problems, enhance community security as well as improve people's health. Nowadays, the use of Social Media, forums or news aggregation websites is massively widespread, with people sharing plenty of details about their life. Some people also use internet to share very serious issues, as a cry for help.  \n",
