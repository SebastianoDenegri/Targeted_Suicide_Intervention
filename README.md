# Targeted Suicide Intervention
Data for Good: classify online redditors for targeted suicide intervention.
Data for good means using Data Science and Machine Learning tools outside of the for-profit sector to help Non-profits and NGOs leverage the power of data for social good and humanitarian causes. The scope of this project is to identify, amongst users in an online community, people at risk of self-harm or suicide, so that actions can be undertaken to provide Targeted Suicide Intervention in a timely-fashioned and sustained manner.
